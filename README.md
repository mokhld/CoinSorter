# CoinSorter

## Introduction

Coded as part of ADS Module in MSc Computer Science at the University of York.

This Coin Sorting program written in Java, with a GUI (via Java FX), that enables the user to check, at most, how many coins of a certain denomination can be exchanged given an input value in pennies and the denomination. It also prints the remainder. For example, given the input value of 352 pennies and the input denomination of £1 coins, the output will be be three £1 coins and a remainder of 52p.

Given a total value in pennies and a coin denomination to exclude, the program also allows the user to determine how many coins and what denominations (prioritising the higher denominations) they can exchange for while excluding a certain coin denomination. The remainder will also be printed. For example, given 563 pennies and excluding the £2 coin, we can exchange for five £1 coins, one 50p coin and one 10p coin, with a remainder of 3p.

## How to Execute:
Run the ```testCoinSorterGUI.java``` from within an IDE of choice. And/or run ```testCoinSorter.java``` for access to the terminal program.
